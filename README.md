How's it going? I'm Brent, a polyglot Software Engineer with a knack for just getting things done. I've been working in Tech in a few different industries (FinTech, AdTech, MarTech) for quite some time, in a variety of capacities. Whether its testing, leading teams to acheive new goals, or solving complex business problems, my philosophy is to always improve and learn.

I'm currently looking for mentorship opportunities (both giving and receiving) **especially** Blacks in Tech, as well as fun open-source projects to contribute to. If any of that sounds cool, feel free to drop me a line!
